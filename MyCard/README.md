## About App

This is the first app I made from scratch to learn about mobile app development.

## What I Learned

During the development of this app I learned:

* Basic SwiftUI commands.
* Creating GitHub repositories and commiting and pushing projects to GitHub.
* Creating app icon in Adobe Photoshop and using online converters to make all the necessary icon files for Assets folder.
* Troubleshooting errors related to running the app on physical device (keychain access errors, etc).
